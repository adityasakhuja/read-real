# Read Real

Read Real is my finaly year project for MEng Electronic and Information Engineering at Imperial College London. Working in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, this project could not be possible without the kind support of Dr. Robert Spence and Dr. Mark Witkowski. 

Read Real is an Automated Real-time Text to Braille Conversion Pen that allows the visually impared a tool to convert any text written in plain text into braille using a sophisticated system comprised of image capture, optical character recognition, text to braille conversion and a refreshable braille display.

Further details coming soon.
